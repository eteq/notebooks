    "Table Access Protocol (TAP) services allow more direct and flexible access to astronomical data than the simpler types of IVOA standard data services. Queries are built with the SQL-like Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL), and can include geographic / spatial queries as well as filtering on other characteristics of the data. This also allows the user fine-grained control over the returned columns, unlike the fixed set of coumns retunred from cone, image, and spectral services.\n",

    "For this example, we'll be using the astroquery TAP/TAP+ client, which was developed by the ESAC Space Data Centre for working with the GAIA catalog, but is interoperable with other valid TAP services, including those at MAST. As an astroquery project, TAP+ documentation is available at ReadTheDocs: http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils/tap.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using TAP+ to call the CAOM Catalog TAP service at MAST and filter the results for TESS-related information. The schema for this catalog is an IVOA standard, and is also described within the service itself.\n",
